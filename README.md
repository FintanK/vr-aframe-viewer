# webvr-angular-aframe

Link: http://fintank.github.io/webvr-angular-aframe/index.html

This application uses Mozilla's AFRAME to allow the viewing of content that I like from across the VR web.
I have also introduced Angular, Bower and Grunt. 

The Grunt task downloads a list of images and generates thumbnails.

VR mode not supported by desktop browsers.
Compatible with Gear VR, Oculus Rift and Google Cardboard.

In the root directory..

- npm install
